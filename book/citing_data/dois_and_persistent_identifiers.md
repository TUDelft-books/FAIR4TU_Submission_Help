# DOIs and Persistent Identifiers

[Persistent identifiers (PIDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier) play a crucial role in maximizing the visibility and impact of your work:

* [Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)](https://www.doi.org/) create permanent links to your datasets and software, significantly increasing discoverability and enabling precise tracking of citations.

* [ORCID iDs](https://orcid.org/) ensure accurate attribution across your career, helping to build a comprehensive research profile that links all your outputs.

Using PIDs facilitates an interconnected research ecosystem, making it easier for others to find and reuse your work. This interconnectedness not only enhances reproducibility but also promotes collaboration. Properly preserved research outputs save time and resources by reducing duplication of effort and streamlining citation processes.
