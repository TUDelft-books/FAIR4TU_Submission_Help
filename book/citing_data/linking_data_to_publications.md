# Linking Data to Publications

By linking your research data to publications, you're actively enhancing the impact and reach of your work while contributing to a more connected and efficient scientific ecosystem.

## Linking research data to publications has numerous benefits

- **Increased discoverability ([FAIR](/introduction/fair_data_and_software)):** When datasets are linked to publications, they become more easily findable for other researchers, increasing the chances of reuse and citation.
- **Enhanced credibility:** Providing access to underlying data strengthens the validity of your published results, fostering trust in your research.
- **Comprehensive research narrative**: Links between publications and data create a fuller picture of your research, allowing others to better understand and build upon your work.

## As a researcher, you stand to gain:

- **Higher [citation](/citing_data/intro) rates:** Linked data and publications tend to receive more citations, boosting your research profile.
- **Increased collaboration opportunities:** Greater visibility can lead to new partnerships and research directions.
- **[Stronger funding applications](/introduction/funders_and_journals):** Demonstrating responsible data sharing and linking can strengthen future grant proposals.

When you link your datasets and software to your published articles, this promotes reproducibility and transparency in research within the scientific community. It furthermore accelerates scientific progress by enabling efficient data reuse and encourages a culture of [open science](https://www.openscience.nl/en) and collaboration.
