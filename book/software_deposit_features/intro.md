# 4TU.ResearchData Software Deposit Features

Uploading software and code offers researchers significant benefits, including long-term preservation, increased visibility, and the ability to obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for their work. 4TU.ResearchData provides a citable, persistent identifier (PID) that enhances the discoverability and recognition of software contributions. Additionally, 4TU.ResearchData is CoreTrustSeal certified, providing assurance about the reliability and quality of both data and software deposited within the repository.

When submitting software to 4TU.ResearchData, researchers should be aware of several key features:

- [Git Integration](/software_deposit_features/git_integration)
- [Versioning and Release Management](/software_deposit_features/versioning_and_release_management)
- [DOI Assignment](/4tu_research_data/key_features)
- [Open File Formats](/submission_workflow/supported_file_formats)
- [Documentation and README files](/submission_workflow/data_curation.md#Metadata-Review-Process-Checklist)

Before uploading, researchers should also check their [institutional research software policies](/introduction/institutional_requirements) to ensure compliance with any specific guidelines or requirements related to software sharing and documentation.
