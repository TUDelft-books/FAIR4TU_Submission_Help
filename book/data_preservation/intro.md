# Data Preservation

4TU.ResearchData repository is a [CoreTrustSeal-certified](https://data.4tu.nl/info/about-4turesearchdata/core-trust-seal) Trusted Digital Repository. This supports robust preservation strategies to maintain data integrity and accessibility over time.

The repository employs a comprehensive preservation policy, addressing file format obsolescence and technological changes. It offers two levels of preservation support:

- **Full preservation:** For preferred file formats, guaranteeing long-term usability through migration, normalization, or conversion when necessary.
- **Bit-level preservation:** For other formats, ensuring access to the original submission file format.

4TU.ResearchData stores data redundantly at three locations (two in Delft, one in Leiden), enhancing data safety and reliability. 

The repository commits to preserving data for a minimum of 15 years, with the possibility of extending this period. After 15 years, 4TU.ResearchData continues to retain the objects until a significant change occurs which affects the conditions of preservation.

More information about 4TU.ResearchDataâ€™s preservation policy is available via [this link](https://data.4tu.nl/s/documents/4TU.Preservation_Policy.pdf). 

In addition to its robust preservation practices, uploading your data to 4TU.ResearchData ensures that your work remains accessible and usable far beyond the initial study. With the security of long-term storage and the potential for extending preservation beyond 15 years, your data continues to contribute to the broader scientific community, supporting new discoveries and innovations long after your project concludes.
