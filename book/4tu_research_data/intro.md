# What is 4TU.ResearchData?

4TU.ResearchData is a research infrastructure, community and training provider whose mission is to enable researchers from science, engineering and design disciplines to make a global impact with research data and software.

## Main Service

4TU.ResearchData is a trusted digital repository which supports Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data and software by offering [curation](/submission_workflow/data_curation.md), sharing, long-term access and [preservation](/data_preservation/intro.md). 

## Repository Infrastructure

The repository runs on a codebase that is available as free and open source software. It is called Djehuty and is available [here](https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty). As Free and Open Source Software system, Djehuty allows developers from various backgrounds to contribute, which leads to an open, flexible and sustainable ecosystem, to enable the sharing, reuse and preservation of research data and software. The repository uses open protocols and standards to promote interoperability between data and systems. Moreover, open protocols foster collaboration and innovation, and promote transparency. 

## Member Institutions

4TU.ResearchData is led by the 4TU.ResearchData Consortium, which consists of [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl), [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en), [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en) and [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm).

## Storage of Datasets

4TU.ResearchData is hosted and managed by the TU Delft Library, where datasets are locally stored on TU Delft servers, and is governed by TU Delftâ€™s legal statements. 4TU.ResearchData staff is responsible for managing and maintaining the data repository, including its preservation policy to guarantee long-term usability of the data it holds.
