## Main Service

4TU.ResearchData is a trusted digital repository which supports Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data and software by offering [curation](/submission_workflow/data_curation.md), sharing, long-term access and [preservation](/data_preservation/intro.md). 

## Repository Infrastructure

The repository runs on a codebase that is available as free and open source software. It is called Djehuty and is available [here](https://github.com/4TUResearchData/djehuty). Our vision is to co-develop this software with our 4TU.ResearchData community of researchers and research support professionals, such as research software engineers and data managers. 

## Member Institutions

4TU.ResearchData is led by the 4TU.ResearchData Consortium, which consists of [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl), [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en), [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en) and [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm).

## Storage of Datasets

4TU.ResearchData is hosted and managed by the TU Delft Library, where datasets are locally stored on TU Delft servers, and is governed by TU Delftâ€™s legal statements. 4TU.ResearchData staff is responsible for managing and maintaining the data repository, including its preservation policy to guarantee long-term usability of the data it holds.
