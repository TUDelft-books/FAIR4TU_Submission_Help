# Institutional Requirements

When uploading datasets and software to the 4TU.ResearchData repository, you should check to ensure you have complied with the policies of your institution. These policies  are established to support responsible data management, ensuring that research data is managed effectively from creation to preservation, and aligns with FAIR. 

It is recommended that you consult our institutionâ€™s **Data Steward** or other research support staff to ensure you are using the appropriate templates and institutional processes. This is particularly important when creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) or sharing data and code.

## Does your institution ask for the following? 

- **[A Data Management Plan (DMP)](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-dmp.html):** A comprehensive DMP is usually required at the start of every project. All project members should regularly update and adhere to these plans.

- **Documentation and Accessibility:** Research data and software, should be properly documented and stored in a repository for at least ten years post-project completion. This ensures that data is accessible for verification and reuse.

- **[Licensing](submission_workflow/choosing_a_licence) and Registration:** Researchers need to  ensure their datasets and software are appropriately licensed and registered. This facilitates legal use and potential commercialization while protecting intellectual property.

By following these guidelines, researchers not only comply with institutional policies but also enhance the visibility and impact of their work. It is crucial to consult with faculty data stewards for specific guidance tailored to individual projects.
