# Introduction: What is a Research Data Repository?

Research data repositories are digital platforms that store, manage, and disseminate valuable research data. These repositories are not mere storage units. They are designed to make research [FAIR](/introduction/fair_data_and_software), foster innovation and accelerate scientific progress.

## Key Functions of Research Data Repositories

1. **Data Preservation:** Repositories safeguard research data, ensuring its availability long after projects conclude.
2. **Enhanced Accessibility:** They democratize data access, breaking down geographical barriers and promoting global scientific collaboration.
3. **Improved Discoverability:** Through [metadata](/submission_workflow/data_curation.md#metadata-review-process-checklist) and indexing, repositories make it easier for researchers to find relevant data.
4. **Facilitated Reusability:** Well-documented datasets enable other researchers to build upon existing work.

## Benefits for Researchers

### [FAIR Principles](/introduction/fair_data_and_software)
Repositories make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable which enables researchers to comply with [funder and journal data-sharing requirements](/introduction/funders_and_journals).

### Attribution
[Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)](/citing_data/dois_and_persistent_identifiers) ensure proper credit for data contributors.

### Impact on Scientific Progress
Scientific transparency and reproducibility are supported by centralizing and organizing research outputs because data repositories create an environment where data can be easily discovered, analyzed, and repurposed. This also catalyzes new discoveries and innovations across various fields of study.
