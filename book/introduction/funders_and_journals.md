# Complying with Funders and Journals

You should find out about funder and journal requirements early on in your research and take steps to ensure that your datasets and software comply with these standards. Try to do this at the earliest possible stage in your research to save time later. 

## Compliance Essentials

### Funder Requirements

Many funding agencies mandate Open Access publishing and data sharing. You should:

- Check specific funder guidelines for [Data Management Plans (DMPs)](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-dmp.html) and sharing policies{cite}`the_turing_way_dmp_2021`. These may be requested at different stages and in different formats. For example: 
    - [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en) requires a data management section in the proposal and asks for a detailed DMP within four months post-award.
    - [ZonMw](https://www.zonmw.nl/en) requires a data management paragraph in the proposal and asks for a DMP within six months post-award.
    - [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en) requests a one-page DMP outline in the proposal and asks for a full DMP within six months post-award.

- Check the funder’s Open Access requirements.
    - Has ‘immediate Open Access’ to data upon publication been requested?
    - Has a budget for potential Open Access costs been requested? 

### Journal Requirements

Publishers increasingly require data availability statements and citations. Such requirements are usually made explicit on the publisher's website. You should:
- Provide clear data availability statements in manuscripts.
- Include proper [citations](/citations/intro.md) for datasets and software.
- Ensure data is accessible to editors and reviewers during submission.

You should make it clear in your DMP that your dataset(s) or software will be made available on 4TU.ResearchData; this can often satisfy both funder and journal requirements.
