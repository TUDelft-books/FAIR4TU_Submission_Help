# Preparing Your Data Package

Creating a well-structured data package is essential for efficient storage and future analysis when depositing in the 4TU.ResearchData Repository. Before proceeding, consider whether you are uploading a single dataset or multiple datasets and whether it would be beneficial to organize them as a [collection](/submission_workflow/data_collections).

Follow these guidelines to develop a comprehensive data package:

**1. Include all relevant files:**
* Gather all datasets, scripts, and documentation necessary for understanding and reproducing your research.
* Decide whether you will publish your  raw or processed data, or both. This depends on how you think the data will be used in the future. 

**2. Use consistent and descriptive [file naming](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/info-management/filenaming):**
* Name files clearly, incorporating details such as project name, date, and version number.
* Avoid special characters and spaces; use underscores instead.

**3. Create a [README](/submission_workflow/readme_and_documentation) file:**
* Document the contents of your data package, explaining the purpose of each file and how they relate to your research.
* Include metadata that describes variables, units, and any specific methodologies used.

**4. Versioning:**
* Ensure that you have selected the correct version of the data code that should be published. 

**5. Format consistency:**
* Use standard, open [file formats](https://data.4tu.nl/s/documents/Preferred_File_Formats_2023.pdf). Using the recommended file formats means you get the benefit of the preservation level offered by 4TU.ResearchData.
* Maintain consistency in formatting across all files.

**6. Quality control:**
* Remove unneeded data.
* Make sure that personal information is either anonymized, pseudonymized and includes full consent for its use.
* Use consistent and meaningful file names that reflect the file content, avoiding spaces and special characters.
* Choose standard, exchangeable or open file formats for long-term sustainability and accessibility.
* If your data consists of many files, consider grouping them in zip bundles according to their content or file format, to make upload and download easier.
* Review all files for errors or inconsistencies before submission.

By following these steps, you will create a comprehensive data package that enhances discoverability and reusability of your research outputs, facilitating long-term [preservation](/data_preservation/intro) in the 4TU.ResearchData Repository.
