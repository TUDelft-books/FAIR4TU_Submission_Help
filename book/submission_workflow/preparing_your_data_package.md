# Preparing Your Data Package

Creating a well-structured data package is essential for efficient storage and future analysis when depositing in the 4TU.ResearchData Repository. Before proceeding, consider whether you are uploading a single dataset or multiple datasets and whether it would be beneficial to organize them as a [collection](/submission_workflow/data_collections).

Follow these guidelines to develop a comprehensive data package:

**1. Include all relevant files:**
* Gather all datasets, scripts, and documentation necessary for understanding and reproducing your research.
* Decide whether you will publish your  raw or processed data, or both. This depends on how you think the data will be used in the future. 

**2. Use consistent and descriptive [file naming](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/filenaming):**
* Name files clearly, incorporating details such as project name, date, and version number.
* Avoid special characters and spaces; use underscores instead.

**3. Create a [README](/submission_workflow/readme_and_documentation) file:**
* Document the contents of your data package, explaining the purpose of each file and how they relate to your research.
* Include metadata that describes variables, units, and any specific methodologies used.

**4. Versioning:**
* Ensure that you have selected the correct version of the datacode that should be published. 

**5. Format consistency:**
* Use standard, open [file formats](https://data.4tu.nl/s/documents/Preferred_File_Formats_2023.pdf). Using the recommended file formats means you get the benefit of the preservation level offered by 4TU.
* Maintain consistency in formatting across all files.

**6. Quality control:**
* Review all files for errors or inconsistencies before submission.
* Validate data integrity to ensure reliability.

**7. Separate [sensitive data](/submission_workflow/setting_access_levels.md#personal--sensitive-data):**
* Identify any confidential or personal information and segregate it from the main dataset.
* Ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

By following these steps, you will create a comprehensive data package that enhances discoverability and reusability of your research outputs, facilitating long-term [preservation](/data_preservation/intro) in the 4TU.ResearchData Repository.
